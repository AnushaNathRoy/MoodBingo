/*
1. send the "turn over" or something to server, one per cell. first one wins.
2. check whether server received it, let's do a printf and check
3. once the server receives it, we will make the variable "turn to play" false, also check if the player will win.
4. now we wait for the "poll" to get over (another major step, will have to break into smaller steps)
5. then we pick another random number from remaining ones, and repeat.
